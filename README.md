Dynamic-Virtual-Assistant

A smart and interactive virtual assistant built using Html, CSS, JavaScript that dynamically responds to user commands and performs real-time tasks such as opening websites, fetching information, answering queries.

Overview

Dynamic Virtual Assistant is a web-based AI-powered application designed to perform everyday tasks using voice commands and natural language interaction.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it leverages browser-based APIs like Web Speech API, Speech Recognition, and Speech Synthesis to enable intelligent, hands-free human-computer interaction.

This project demonstrates the integration of AI, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and browser APIs to create a personal assistant that automates tasks such as:
Opening websites
Managing notes and schedules
Providing real-time weather updates
Telling jokes and random facts

 Features

 Voice-Activated Commands – Perform actions hands-free using speech recognition
 Real-Time Speech Feedback – Uses text-to-speech for interactive responses
 Smart Web Navigation – Opens popular sites like Google, YouTube, Instagram, etc.
 Local Note Management – Add, view, and delete notes using voice commands (stored in localStorage)
 Weather Integration – Fetches live weather data using OpenWeatherMap API
 Fun Add-ons – Tells jokes and random facts using public APIs
 Responsive Design – Built with modern UI using HTML5 & CSS3

Technology	Purpose

1.HTML5	Structure of the web interface   
2.CSS3	Styling and responsiveness   
3.JavaScript (Vanilla)	Logic, event handling, and AI integration   
4.Web Speech API	Speech recognition and text-to-speech synthesis   
5.OpenWeatherMap API	Real-time weather updates   
6.Local Storage API	Saving notes and schedule data locally

 How It Works

1. The assistant greets the user automatically .
2. When the user clicks the microphone button, speech recognition starts.
3. Spoken input is converted to text and analyzed.
4. Based on keywords, the assistant performs the appropriate task (like opening YouTube or fetching weather).
5. Responses are given through synthesized voice output.

 Example Voice Commands

 “Open YouTube”   
 “What is the weather in Mysuru?”   
 “Take a note: Complete report submission”  
 “Show my schedule”   
 “Tell me a joke”   
 “What’s the time?”
